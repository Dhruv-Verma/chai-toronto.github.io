    There has been recent interest in translating cognitive exams from paper and desktop monitors to smartphones in order for them to be carried out anytime, anywhere, and by anyone. We are interested in extending this trend to an even more sophisticated technology: virtual reality (VR). Although VR is not yet as ubiquitous as smartphones, anticipating its proliferation presents a few exciting opportunities. Since VR is an immersive experience, we can minimize the chance of distractions and elicit stronger responses from patients. We can also gather rich physiological information: gaze position, pupil dilation, and potentially even heart rate in some newer devices.
