  <h1>Undergraduate Students</h1>
  <p>
    At the start of every session (fall semester, winter semester, summer break), our group identifies projects that would be significantly accelerated with the help of an undergraduate student. These projects can require a variety of skills: building a smartphone app, building machine learning models, conducting interviews, helping run longitudinal studies, etc. Undergraduate students at various experience levels may be suitable for these positions depending on the project's timeline and the skills that are already on hand. The list below describes the positions that are available for the current semester, but note that all applicants will be considered for all positions:
