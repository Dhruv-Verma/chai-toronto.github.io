The Computational Health and Interaction (CHAI) lab is led by Prof. Alex Mariakakis in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto. Our main research focuses on using ubiquitous and emergent technologies (e.g., smartphones, wearables, virtual reality) to address problems related to people’s health and wellbeing. We investigate research questions from multiple perspectives — hardware, software, design, and human factors — using our diverse expertise in machine learning, computer vision, signal processing, and user-centered design. We both develop new sensing technologies for measuring physiological, behavioral, and contextual health indicators and also take the time to understand the implications of these technologies in people’s hands. We proactively engage relevant stakeholders to ensure that our designs are sensitive to the needs of their potential users. As such, we frequently collaborate with academics, clinicians, global health organizations, special interest groups, and industrial collaborators.
