  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>The Computational Health and Interaction (CHAI) lab is led by <a href="https://mariakakis.github.io">Prof. Alex Mariakakis</a> in the <a href="https://cs.toronto.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a>. Our main research focuses on using ubiquitous and emergent technologies (e.g., smartphones, wearables, virtual reality) to address problems related to people’s health and wellbeing. We investigate research questions from multiple perspectives — hardware, software, design, and human factors — using our diverse expertise in machine learning, computer vision, signal processing, and human-computer interaction. We both develop new sensing technologies for measuring physiological, behavioral, and contextual health indicators and also take the time to understand the implications of these technologies in people’s hands. We proactively engage relevant stakeholders to ensure that our designs are sensitive to the needs of their potential users. As such, we frequently collaborate with academics, clinicians, global health organizations, special interest groups, and industrial collaborators.</p>

  <p>The projects listed below represent just a subset of our group's current work. The categories are loosely defined since our work often spans multiple fields of computer science and engineering. Feel free to reach out to either the project leads or <a href="https://mariakakis.github.io">Prof. Alex Mariakakis</a> to learn more about these projects or any others.</p>
